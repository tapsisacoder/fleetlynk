              Every day, fleet managers across Southern Africa lose money to fuel theft, vehicle downtime, and chaos they can't see or control.
            </p>

            <p>
              The only solutions? Expensive GPS devices that break, get stolen, or stop working when you need them most. You're stuck paying thousands per truck, locked into contracts, and still blind when hardware fails.
            </p>

            <p className="font-semibold text-primary">
              There's a better way.
            </p>

            <p>
              FleetLynk uses the phones your drivers already carry. No devices to install. No hardware to replace. Just software that worksâ€”tracking vehicles, monitoring fuel, and putting you back in control.
            </p>

            <p>
              We're not building this alone. We're building it with 30 fleet managers who are tired of the old way and ready to shape the future of African logistics.
