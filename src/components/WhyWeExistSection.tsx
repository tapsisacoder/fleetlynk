              Every day across Southern Africa, fleet managers juggle spreadsheets, WhatsApp messages, paper receipts, and guesswork. Compliance deadlines sneak up. Fuel costs spiral. Maintenance surprises drain cash. You're working IN your business when you should be working ON it.
            </p>

            <p>
              We built FleetLynk because we've seen these struggles firsthand. This isn't Silicon Valley software adapted for Africaâ€”it's built from the ground up for how Southern African logistics actually works.
            </p>

            <p>
              FleetLynk gives you one platform to manage trips, drivers, compliance, costs, invoicing, and documents. Vehicle tracking is optional (using driver smartphones or affordable hardware we're integrating soon). Everything you need, nothing you don't.
